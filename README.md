# pychorus
A simple Python API wrapper library for the Clone Hero chart searching tool Chorus.

# Requirements
pychorus requires `gdown`, a Google Drive download library, and `requests`.<br>
Install them both by running these commands<br>
`pip install gdown`<br>
`pip install requests`<br>

# Known limitations
- Occasionally, Chorus will have a song/setlist that links to a YouTube link, and currently this library won't be able to download those.

# Why did I make this module?
I find navigating the website a little clunky, and downloading from the Google Drive is a slow pain with the "preparing" and "zipping" that Google does behind the scenes when downloading. This module downloads much, much faster than using a browser. And also, I'm just a hobbyist and thought it'd be fun to make a module for my favorite rhythm game :)

# Wrapping up
You can use this module for any project you please.

If you get any issues please report them to the issues page and I'll try to fix them right away.
